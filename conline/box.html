	<div class="flavor">Ansley is yelling at her computer. When you walk up to her and ask what's wrong, she says "It's <span class="redletters">mission critical</span> that I get this r&#233;sum&#233; AI working so I can process lots of people to figure out who are the best people to recruit to the company. However, it's not working and I can't figure out why." Once you look at it, you're pretty sure you'll know when you have found the answer to this puzzle.</div>
