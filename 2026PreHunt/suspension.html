		<p>I’ve seen him…</p>
		<ul>
			<li>… leaving a pet shop with terriers in California.</li>
			<li>… crossing a Quebec staircase, right at the top.</li>
			<li>… passing a display of paintings in a small Vermont village, near the parked limousine of an old art lover.</li>
			<li>… drinking champagne at a party in a Rio mansion.</li>
			<li>… in a newspaper ad, stranded in the Atlantic.</li>
			<li>… riding a bus with a very handsome man in the Riviera one day.</li>
			<li>… from behind, watching an acrobatic troupe in the Morocco marketplace, wearing a suit and puIng his hands into his pockets.</li>
			<li>… in Sydney, standing with two other men on the steps of a government building.</li>
			<li>… just outside of a Phoenix office.</li>
			<li>… in a Manhattan apartment, where he was winding a clock.</li>
			<li>… bouncing a child on his knee in a hotel in Copenhagen.</li>
			<li>… carrying a trumpet across a Frisco street.</li>
			<li>… at a flat in London, staring out from a photograph of a reunion dinner.</li>
			<li>… trying to board at the railway station in a town called Metcalf, with a double bass fiddle.</li>
			<li>… just missing a green city bus in Manhattan, where the doors unceremoniously closed in his face.</li>
