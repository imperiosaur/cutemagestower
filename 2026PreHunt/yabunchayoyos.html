		<p>At last, you've made it! It was a long and arduous quest, but you have finally at the mountaintop home of Yosef Yoskovitz, the greatest yo-yo artist of all time. He is know to be a recluse, private and cantankerous, but it is your hope that you can convince him to teach you the art of the yo-yo.</p>
		<p>When he opens the door to find you there, Yosef sighs. He knows even before you speak why you are there. "Another would-be acolyte," he says wearily. You open your mouth ot reply, but he waves a hand. "Here," he says, reaching for something just inside his front door. "Take these." He hands you a sheaf of papers. "To master the yo-yo, you must first master your own mind. If you can conquer the challenges in these pages, then I will consider taking you in as my student. If you fail, you will leave here and never return. These are my terms. Take them or leave them."</p>
		<p>He turns around and shuffles away, spinning a yo-yo as he goes, shutting the door behind him. You were so rattled, you never even got to say a word! But if there's a chance he might become your tutor, you are determined to meet whatever challenges he throws at you. You sit down and shuffle through the papers he gave you, and discover that they are a series of puzzles - one for each of thirteen different yo-yo tricks...</p>
