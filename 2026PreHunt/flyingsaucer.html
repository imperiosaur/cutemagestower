			<div>The Xyrmbats are armed with Deceptor missiles; a Deceptor missile aimed in one direction follows a looping course, ultimately hitting a target 90° from the direction of aim. (In particulary, if a Deceptor missile is <em>aimed at</em> a given target, it will never <em>hit</em> that target.) The Oombs are armed with Straightbolt missiles, which fly straight. (Thus, if a Straightbolt missile is aimed at a target, it wil always hit that target.)</div>

			<li>Every missile was aimed north, south, east, or west (but not necessarily aimed <em>at</em> anyone).</li>
			<li>Every missile fired hit someone adjacent to the firer.</li>
			<li>No two missiles fired by the same creature followed the same trajectory.</li>
			<li>Every Xyrmbat who fired aimed all her missiles in the same direction.</li>
			<li>Every Xyrmbat who fired fired a different number of missiles.</li>
			<li>Every Oomb further east than Captain Xigna got hit exactly once.</li>
			<li>Captain Xigna fired exactly one missile; it was left-handed.</li>
			<li>No Oomb who was aimed at fired.</li>
			<li>Every Oomb who was not aimed at fired exactly one more missile in a north-south direction than in an east-west direction.</li>
			<li>Exactly four missiles were aimed north.</li>
			<li>The difference between the number of missiles a creature fired and got hit with was never exactly two.</li>
