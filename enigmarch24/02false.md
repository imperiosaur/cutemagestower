# False Akari

Below is a standard akari. Place light bulbs in the grid to light up every white square. Each bulb lights up every square up, down, left, and right from it, but is blocked by black squares. Each number represents exactly how many bulbs are orthogonally adjacent to it.

Well, except all of the number clues are false. Each one is actually showing a number that is NOT the number of bulbs adjacent to it. Therefore, a 1 clue could have 0, 2, 3, or 4 bulbs adjacent to it.
