Look, I’ve tried singing, but no matter how hard I try to hold a note, something else just comes out. Maybe this is why I didn’t pass my audition for the Sound of Music…

* What I try to sing...
  * Comedian Marovitch
  * Fold
  * Love deeply
  * Remove color from
  * Scalped
  * Shower tools
  * Strike firmly
* ... what actually comes out
  * 4,840 square yards
  * Healthy food
  * Remove a starter
  * Satisfy
  * Tear
  * Waterbirds
  * With "The", a UK game show
