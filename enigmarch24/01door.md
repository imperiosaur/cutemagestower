If there is one thing escape room enthusiasts know about doors - it's that they exist to put keys into! Each row of the grid contains a word that goes with "door", and each column of the grid contains a word that goes with key. All of the "door" words read left-to-right, and all of the "key" words read top-to-bottom. These words may not be in consecutive squares - they could "jump" over words going in the other direction.

Each "key" unlocks exactly one door. The "keys" do this by overlapping in one square with a "door". These overlaps are the key (actually "door") to the puzzle.
