I wrote an extravaganza! Are you ready for your First Day on the Job?


I was one of the people on the official program for Conline 5, an online puzzle convention held over Zoom & Discord. I was asked to write an extravaganza, aka a small puzzle hunt.

It turns out that my definition of small is maybe not other people's definition of small.

I have more to say about how I wrote this in a future post, but for now, have at it!

A couple notes before you dive in:

* At the bottom of this post will be a link to a Google Spreadsheet. It contains a link to the puzzles and also acts as the answer checker. Make a copy of the spreadsheet for your own use.
* There is a hidden tab on the Google spreadsheet. Don't look at it. The answers are in plain sight. In addition, do not look at the source code for any of the puzzles.
* Every time you solve six puzzles, the link to the puzzles will update. It will contain all the same information as your last link, but it will unlock new puzzles and/or update previous ones.

Have fun!
